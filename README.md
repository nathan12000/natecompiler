# Compiler

# Introduction
A compiler is a special type of system software that translates a program written in a high-level programming language (such as C, C++, or Java) into machine-level language that a computer can understand and execute. This translation process allows programmers to write code using human-readable instructions instead of complex binary codes.

The compiler works by analyzing the source code for errors, checking its syntax and semantics, and then converting it into an optimized form of machine code or intermediate code. By doing so, it helps improve program efficiency and ensures that the code runs correctly on the target system. Compilers play a crucial role in software development, acting as a bridge between human thinking and computer hardware.
